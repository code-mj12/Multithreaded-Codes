# Multithreaded-Codes
Matrix multiplcation using OpenMP and MPI
#
In Matrix Multithreaded folder, first.cpp has matrix multiplication using MPI(pthread) library, while the third.cpp uses row-wise threaded multiplication
##
MPI_broadcast.c file uses mpi broadcast function to broadcast values
##
OpenMP folder contains code using openmp functions. q1.c checks prime, q1b.c check prime using guided chunks, q1c.c checks prime using reduction, q2.c find a number in array using omp sections, q3.c count occurences using dynamic scheduling
